# NLP
ðŸ’¡ This is a repository of my work from my NLP class in the second semester of the 2023 academic year. 

Many of the things **I learned in the NLP class sparked my interest in the LLM, which is currently a hot topic.**

Currently, I only have basic, hands-on code, but I will continue to work on it and complete the repository! 

Areas I'd like to research in the future include<br>
ðŸ’¡ Lightweighting of LLMs<br>
ðŸ’¡ Multi-Modal Learning with LLM<br>

Thank you !
